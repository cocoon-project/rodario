I care much\r\nmore about the first than I do the second. As such, it is not recommended at\r\nthis time that you even consider using this in production code. All of the\r\nGitHub releases are marked as \"pre-release\", and all of the versions on pypi\r\nhave an alpha designator, but I figured being completely explicit about this\r\nwas probably best.\r\n",
